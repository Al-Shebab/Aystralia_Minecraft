# Examples:
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%::COMMAND:tppos %x% %y% %z%"
# "%player% was killed by %killer%::&cLocations: X:%x%, Y:%y%, Z:%z%"

# Permissions Based Messages
#
# For players that have a specific permission set, EX: deathmessages.premium, the death message
# will be sent that is formatted as followed:
# PERMISSION[YOUR.PERM.HERE]%player% dead lol
#
# Players that are in a region (With WorldGuard hook enabled) and is defined below, will be sending a custom
# region messages.
# Formatted as followed: "REGION[REGION_NAME]%player% died in a region"
# Example:
#
# Mobs:
#   player:
#     Melee:
#       - "%player% was slain by %killer%"
#       - "PERMISSION[deathmessages.premium]&6Premium %player% &fdied to %killer%
#       - "REGION[spawn]Idiot %player% died in spawn lol"
#       If the player has permission and in a region

#
# To completely remove the message for a certain death. Configure as followed:
# Natrual-Death:
#   Bed: []
# or
# Mobs:
#   Creeper:
#     Solo:
#       Explosion: []

# Due for there being no cure for laziness, this option ignores everything in the Mobs section and makes all messages
# appear the same.
