# 
# check_updates: <true/false>
#   Should DeluxeMenus check if there are any updates available on Spigot and inform ops there is an update available.
# 
# ==============================================================
# 
# PER ITEM PERMISSION AND PRIORITY INFO:
# 
# Per item permissions and priorities are optional.
# High priority = 1, Lowest priority = 2147483647.
# This allows you to show different items for a specific menu slot depending on the highest priority
# item permission a player has. This makes your menus very dynamic :)
# 
# You CAN NOT specify a permission without a priority!
# You CAN specify a priority without a permission.
# You should always create a low priority item without a permission which will act as the no permission
# item if a player does not have permission for any of the items that require permission, otherwise
# no item will be set in the slot if a player does not have permission for any of the permission items.
# 
# ==============================================================
# 
# GUI menu configuration:
# 
# You can create as many GUI menus you like.
# Every menu name must be unique. There can not be duplicate menu names!
# Players must have permission for a GUI menu to open one!
# Ops should automatically have permission for any GUI menu.
# 
# Permission to open a GUI menu is: deluxemenus.guimenu.<menuName>
# 
# You specify the command which opens the GUI menu. Make sure this command
# does not conflict with any existing commands on your server!
# A GUI menu without an open command specified will not be loaded!
# 
# GUI menus configuration layout:
# 
# gui_menus:
#   <menuName>:
#     menu_title: '<title of menu goes here>'
#     command: <command to open this menu goes here>
#     inventory_type: '<add this option if you want to create a menu of a different InventoryType aside from chest>'
# 	 open_requirement:
# 	   requirements:
# 	     <unique name for this requirement>:
# 		   type: <type for this requirement>
# 		   <unique options per requirement type would go here>
# 		   deny_commands:
# 		   - '[message] you do not meet requirements to open this menu'
#       - '[message] you do not have permission to open testmenu'
# 
# 
# Below is a full example of use cases for requirements:
# 
# 				menu_title: 'Menu that requires permission to open'
# 					open_command: testmenu
# 					size: 9
# 					open_requirement:
# 					  requirements:
# 					    this_requirement_name:
# 					      type: has permission
# 					      permission: 'testmenu.open'
# 					      deny_commands:
# 					      - '[message] you do not have permission to open testmenu'
# 					items:
# 					  mymenuitem:
# 					    priority: 2
# 					    material: DIRT
# 					    slot: 0
# 					    name 'You dont have 100 diamonds to view this item'
# 					  mymenuitem:
# 					    priority: 1
# 					    material: DIAMOND
# 					    slot: 0
# 					    name 'You have lots of diamonds so you can see this item'
# 					    view_requirement:
# 					      requirements:
# 					        diamond_requirement:
# 					          type: has item
# 					          material: diamond
# 					          amount: 100
# 					    left_click_requirement:
# 					      requirements:
# 					        money_requirement:
# 					          type: '>='
# 					          input: '%vault_eco_balance_fixed%'
# 					          output: 1000
# 					          deny_commands:
# 					          - '[message] you only have %vault_eco_balance_fixed%'
# 					    left_click_commands:
# 					    - '[message] you have over 1000 dollars!'
# 					    right_click_requirement:
# 					      requirements:
# 					        staff_requirement:
# 					          type: string equals
# 					          input: '%vault_rank%'
# 					          output: staff
# 					          deny_commands:
# 					          - '[message] you are not staff'
# 					    right_click_commands:
# 					    - '[message] you are staff'
# 
# deny_commands: are optional and will be executed if the requirement is not met.
# ==============================================================
# 
# 
# You do not need to specify item options that you don't use!
# The only required entries for a gui menu item to be valid are:
# 
# A valid material
# A valid slot
# 
# Every item in the items list must have a unique <item identifier>
# 
# If you choose to update placeholders for a specific item, you must specify update_interval: <time>
# in the GUI menu options for the specific GUI menu.
# Only GUI menus with at least one item that has update: true will update those specific items placeholders.
# 
# Every click_command must start with a specific identifier to know what to do for the execution.
# Valid click_command identifiers:
# 
# [console] - Execute a command from the console
# Usage: - '[console] <command with no slash>'
# 
# [player] - Execute a command for the menu viewer
# Usage: - '[player] <command with no slash>'
# 
# [commandevent] - Fire a PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent for commands that do not use the bukkit command system
# Usage: - '[commandevent] <command with no slash>'
# 
# [message] - Send a message to the menu viewer
# Usage: - [message] <message to send to the player
# 
# [openguimenu] - Open a GUI menu (can only be used in GUI menu click_commands)
# Usage: - '[openguimenu] <guiMenuName>'
# 
# [connect] - Connect to the specified bungee server
# Usage: - '[connect] <serverName>'
# 
# [close] - Close the viewers open menu
# Usage: - '[close]
# 
# [refresh] - Refresh items in the current menu view
# Usage: - '[refresh]
# 
# [broadcastsound] - Broadcast a sound to the server
# Usage: - '[broadcastsound]
# 
# [sound] - Play a sound for a the specific player
# Usage: - '[sound]
# 
# [json] - Send a json message to the menu viewer
# Usage: - '[json] {"text":"message"}'
# 
# 
# 
# You can delay any of the click command being performed by ending the command with
# <delay=(time in TICKS)>
# example:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] it has been 5 seconds since the menu closed!<delay=100>'
#     - '[message] it has been 10 seconds since the menu closed!<delay=200>'
# 
# A delay should NOT be added to the [close] or [openguimenu] actions
# as it could potentially cause unknown issues or glitches with menus.
