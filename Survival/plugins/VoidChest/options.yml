  #
  # In case of you having issues with voidchests being deleted upon a restart, increase the number by a bit.
  #
  # How many ticks should the plugin wait before loading data (voidchests, player related data, etc)
  # This will allow worlds and other things to load before voidchest so that you can avoid issues such as voidchest
  # attempting to load voidchests in worlds that have yet to load.
  #
  # This should only be modified if servers are having issues with worlds loading after the voidchest plugin has loaded.
  # Recommended load-delay interval is any number from 1 to 10, the highest, the more time the data will delay to load.
  # 
  # Any number that is < 1 will make the plugin instantly load data when the plugin enabled as well.
